# Hybrid Perk Deck
A mod that provides multiple buffs for *PAYDAY: The Heist*.

This mod combines and adjusts the effects of the other Perk Deck mods originally made by [Dr_Newbie](https://modworkshop.net/user/dr_newbie) and submitted to modworkshop.net. No copyright infringement is intended.

## Effects
When using this mod:
### [Muscle](https://modworkshop.net/mod/27990)
- You will have 50% extra base health.
- You will passively regenerate 0.6% of your health every second.
- Each shot from your firearms has a 0.2% chance of intimidating nearby enemies, forcing them to surrender.
  - You can then yell at them to cuff themselves like normal.
### [Rogue](https://modworkshop.net/mod/26078)
- You have a 15% chance to ignore ("dodge") incoming damage.
- You swap between firearms 200% faster.
### Equipment
Equipment bonuses only apply when using the respective equipment they apply to. The equipment must be selected in the menu before starting the heist.
- The Toolkit now provides significantly higher bonuses to interaction speed (12.5% per upgrade level, up to 50% at level 4).
- The Extra Cable Ties equipment now provides double the extra cable ties it normally would (2 per upgrade level, up to 8 at level 4).

You can change these numbers to be whatever you want by editing the variables in `upgradestweakdata.lua`. For context, I have also added comments next to each variable that briefly explain what it does and what its previous values were, both in the vanilla game and with the previous versions of the mods (when applicable).
